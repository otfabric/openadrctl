# AGENTS.md — openadrctl

## What this is

Command-line tool for OpenADR 3 built on [go-openadr](https://github.com/otfabric/go-openadr): act as a VEN or as Business Logic, serve a test VTN, listen for notifications. Pure Go, one binary. Profile: **cli**.

## Organisation standards

This repository follows **otfabric/engineering policy 1.2**, profile **cli** (`.otfabric/policy.yaml`, mode `enforce`). Where this file and the organisation standards disagree, this file wins here — say so in your report.

## Where the truth lives

| Question | Source |
|---|---|
| Exit codes (script-facing API) | docs/exitcodes.md |
| JSON output contract | docs/json-output.md |
| Commands and usage | README.md |
| How to contribute | CONTRIBUTING.md |
| Protocol behaviour | go-openadr |
| Release history | RELEASE.md (`## vX.Y.Z` … `---`) |

## Hard rules

1. Exit codes and JSON output are a public contract: a change is called out in RELEASE.md and documented in docs/exitcodes.md or docs/json-output.md.
2. Never lower `COVERAGE_MIN` or the CI `coverage-min`, add lint suppressions without a reason, or skip or delete tests to make CI pass.
3. Never invent protocol semantics or claim interoperability or conformance beyond recorded evidence; protocol questions go to go-openadr.
4. `github.com/otfabric/*` dependencies are pinned to released tags; no committed `replace` directives.
5. A change that needs `--yes` is refused without it (exit 2).
6. Documentation shows real output: run the command and paste what it printed.
7. A test that waits for something waits for the record that says it happened, never for a fixed time.

## Commands

| When you change… | Run |
|---|---|
| anything | `make check` |
| the command line, exit codes or `main` | `make e2e` (builds the binary and runs it) |
| interop-relevant behaviour | `scripts/interop.sh` (OpenLEADR VTN of openadr-interop, Docker) |

## Definition of Done

`make check` green; tests for new commands, error paths included; exit codes and JSON documented; RELEASE.md section for user-visible changes.

## Git and releases

Branches and PRs. Do not push to `main`, tag or run the Release workflow unless the maintainer asks in the session.
